## About Me
Welcome to my website! My name is Omodayo Origunwa, but you can call me Dayo. I am originally from Oakland, California, and moved to the east coast for college and the start of my career. Some of my passions include soccer, painting and data science. I made this website to showcase some of the work I am proud of, let me know what you think!

This website is a work in progress, feedback is welcome on the repo [here](https://github.com/dinoDayo/dinoDayo.github.io).

### General notes...
- Bundle manages dependencies for Ruby projects. Ruby dependencies are called gems. To add a dependency to your project, first add the ruby dependency with `gem install <package_name> -v <version_if_needed> --user-install`, then add the dependency to your project using `bundle add <package-name>`.
