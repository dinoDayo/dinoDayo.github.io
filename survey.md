## The *Survey*
Welcome Friend! 

Thank you for taking the time to help me with this survey!

**TL;DR**: The responses will be anonymized, honesty is the priority. Will send out results on/after June 17th upon request. No wrong answers, goal is to get a better understanding of myself. 
 
### The Why...
This may come as a surprise to you but I have been in state of transition in many areas of my life over the past few months, including but not limited to residential zipcode, gainful employment, and personal relationships. 
My intention with this survey is to develop a better understanding of myself in the hopes that this new understanding will inform the many important personal decisions I am making. 

### The Questions...
The questions below are intended to act as prompts; there is not expected format for the response. More importantly though, **there are no wrong answers.**
ie. single. word. responses. or 
     - bullet
     - points 
You get it. 
If you are still interested in more theory, check out this link I found that substantiates most of what I was going for [here](https://career.fsu.edu/students/plan-your-career/career-decision-making){:target="\_blank"}.

Best,
