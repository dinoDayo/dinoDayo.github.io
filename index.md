### About
Welcome to my website! My name is Omodayo Origunwa, Dayo for short. I am originally from Oakland, California, and moved to the east coast for college and the start of my career. Some of my passions include soccer, painting and data science. I made this website to showcase some of the work I am proud of, let me know what you think!

This website is a work in progress, so check back in every once in a while for updates!
