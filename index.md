## About Me
---

Welcome to my website!
 
My name is Omodayo Origunwa, but I go by Dayo. "Omo" means "The child" and "Dayo" means "bringer of joy", which was why I drop the "Omo". I do my best to I live up to the title and I'd like to think I do a pretty good job of it.

I am originally from the West Coast of the United States, and moved to the East Coast for college and the start of my career. So far, I have had the opportunity to work at a handful of interesting startups in the Boston area, spanning a variety of industries including but not limited to Energy & Sustainability, Engineering Management, and Marketing. I have also been fortunate enough to find a community willing to support me in the development of a personal brand, something I leverage in my freelance work to support my clients in realizing their vision. 
Outside of work, I will most likely be found on the soccer field, at a chess board, or on the occasional run. All other hobbies are aspirational at best at this point, an inconvenient truth I have been struggling to accept...For example, I also paint, am learning the bass guitar, am a big podcast/music listener, etc. The list goes on, but there are only so many hours in the day. 

I threw this website together to serve as a reference for my professional and personal engegments. Let me know what you think!
