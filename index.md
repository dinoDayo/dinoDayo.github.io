## About Me
---

Welcome to my website!
 
My name is Omodayo Origunwa, Dayo for short. I am originally from Oakland, California, and moved to the east coast for college and the start of my career. So far, I have worked at a handful of startups in the Boston area, as an Energy Analyst at an Energy Consulting Firm, a Software Engineer at a Energy Efficiency Company, and most recently, as a Software Engineer at an Engineering Management Company. Outside of work, some of my passions include soccer, painting and chess. I made this website to showcase some of the work I am proud of, let me know what you think!

This website is a work in progress, check back in every once in a while for updates!
